# Potential Skills for Future Development

This document outlines additional skills that would be valuable for the standardization and maturity of this test automation framework.

## 1. Implement Page Objects
**Summary**: Detailed guidelines on creating and maintaining Page Object classes. This skill would cover locator strategies (By, XPath, CSS), encapsulation of web elements, and methods for user interactions, ensuring a strict separation between test logic and UI details.
**Why needed**: To enforce the Page Object Model (POM) pattern currently used in the project and prevent code duplication.

## 2. Manage Web Drivers
**Summary**: Instructions on configuring and managing the `DriverFactory` and `DriverManager`. This includes handling different browser types (Chrome, Firefox), managing driver lifecycle (setup/teardown), and configuring headless modes or browser arguments via `config.properties`.
**Why needed**: To standardize how browsers are initialized and ensure thread safety in parallel executions.

## 3. Debug Test Failures
**Summary**: A guide on troubleshooting failed tests. This would cover reading stack traces, using the debugger in an IDE, analyzing screenshots/logs generated by the framework, and isolating environmental issues vs. application bugs.
**Why needed**: To reduce the time spent diagnosing issues and increase team velocity.

## 4. Integrate with CI/CD
**Summary**: Steps to integrate the test suite into a Continuous Integration pipeline (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions). This would cover running tests via Maven in a CI environment, handling dependencies, and publishing Allure reports to a dashboard.
**Why needed**: To enable automated regression testing on every code commit or nightly build.

## 5. Manage Test Data
**Summary**: Strategies for handling dynamic test data. This goes beyond static properties files and covers techniques like using data faker libraries, database queries for data setup/cleanup, or reading from external files (CSV, JSON, Excel) for data-driven testing.
**Why needed**: To support more complex scenarios that require unique or state-specific data.

## 6. Visual Regression Testing
**Summary**: Integrating tools to perform visual comparisons of UI elements. This would define how to capture baseline screenshots and compare them against current runs to detect unintended visual changes.
**Why needed**: To catch UI bugs that functional assertions might miss (e.g., layout shifts, CSS issues).
